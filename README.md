# iv4xr-jmonkey-demo

Contain a simple demo of writing an `aplib` test for a JME game. [JME (JMonkey Engine)](https://jmonkeyengine.org/) is an open source game engine for Java --- [JME Github repository](https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine).

As the demo we will use a simple JME game called _Rolling the Monkey_. The game is originally provided as [an example game by JME](https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/tree/master/jme3-examples/src/main/java/jme3test/games). We copy it to this project.
